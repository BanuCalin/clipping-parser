In talking with people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasising—and keep on emphasising—the things on which you agree. Keep emphasising, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose. Get the other person saying ‘Yes, yes’ at the outset. Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying ‘No’. The skilful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of ‘Yes’ responses. This sets the psychological process of the listeners moving in the affirmative direction.

When a person says ‘No’ and really means it, he or she is doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organism—glandular, nervous, muscular—gathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says ‘Yes’, none of the withdrawal activites takes place. The organism is in a forward-moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more ‘yeses’ we can, at the very outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.

Most people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking themselves. Let the other people talk themselves out. They know more about their business and problems than you do. So ask them questions. Let them tell you a few things. If you disagree with them you may be tempted to interrupt. But don’t. It is dangerous. They won’t pay attention to you while they still have a lot of ideas of their own crying for expression. So listen patiently and with an open mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage them to express their ideas fully.

Twenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage, said some things that readers of this book might use today: ‘The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.’ RULE 7 Let the other person have ownership of the idea. By the very act of arguing, you awake the patient’s reason; and once it is awake, who can foresee the result? —C.S. Lewis Do the hard jobs first.

Dr Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book Educational Psychology: ‘Sympathy the human species universally craves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults… show their bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details of surgical operations. “Self-pity” for misfortunes real or imaginary is, in some measure, practically a universal practice.’ So, if you want to win people to your way of thinking, put in practice… RULE 9 Be sympathetic to the other person’s ideas and desires. Friendship improves happiness and abates misery, by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief. —Marcus Tullius Cicero Don’t be afraid to give your best to what seemingly are small jobs.

Whenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would like to do; and then, without veering off direction, you will move straight to the goal. Keep your mind on the great and splendid things you would like to do, and then, as the days go gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing upon the opportunities that are required for the fulfillment of your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running tide the element it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual… Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude—the attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered. We become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis.

Use of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of B.F. Skinner’s teachings. This great contemporary psychologist has shown by experiments with animals and with humans that when criticism is minimised and praise emphasised, the good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.

1 Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person. 2 Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do. 3 Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants. 4 Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest. 5 Match those benefits to the other person’s wants. 6 When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit. We could give a curt order like this: ‘John, we have customers coming in tomorrow and I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish the counter.’ Or we could express the same idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the task: ‘John, we have a job that should be completed right away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced with it later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show them the stockroom, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep it out , put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish the counter, it would make us look efficient and you will have done your part to provide a good company image.’

A much sought-after and luscious honey in Turkey, for example, is made from pine honeydew. This is a sugar-rich secretion produced by a scale insect, Marchalina hellenica, which lives in cracks in the bark of the red pine tree (Pinus brutia) and feeds exclusively on the resinous sap. Bees collect the honeydew, and with a specific enzyme, invertase, break down its sugar (sucrose) into simpler glucose and fructose. The final product, honey, is the most concentrated simple sugar source in nature, with the specific plant species from which it derives, red pine in this instance, contributing special flavors and aromas.

About the same time that fruit trees were proliferating around the globe, S. cerevisiae appears to have acquired an extra copy of its entire genome. Further rearrangements enabled it to proliferate in the absence of oxygen, and the alcohol it produced destroyed much of its competition. Other microorganisms, including many spoilage- and disease-causing yeasts and bacteria, simply cannot tolerate alcohol in concentrations above 5 percent, but S. cerevisiae survives in fermenting substances with more than twice this concentration of alcohol.

The yeast pays a cost for its success. In producing more alcohol, it forgoes making more of the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides living organisms with the energy for essential biological processes. Pure aerobic metabolism yields thirty-six molecules of ATP from glucose. S. cerevisiae makes only two molecules of ATP in air, channeling the rest of the glucose into the production of alcohol to be deployed against its competitors.

S. cerevisiae’s apparent loss later becomes its gain. Because of the doubling of its genome, each yeast cell develops two versions of the gene that controls the production of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). This enzyme converts acetaldehyde, an end product of glycolysis, into alcohol. One version of the enzyme (ADH1) reliably processes sugar into alcohol in an oxygen-free environment, whereas the other (ADH2) is activated only after most of the sugar has been consumed and oxygen levels start to rise again. For S. cerevisiae, this happens after many competing microbes have been destroyed. Then ADH2 springs into action, converting alcohol back into acetaldehyde and ultimately generating more ATP. Of course, other microorganisms, such as acetic acid–producing bacteria, which can tolerate high alcohol levels, wait in the wings. They are ready to turn any remaining alcohol into vinegar unless another hungry organism acts faster or is able, like a human, to improvise a way to preserve the alcohol.

If our ancient samples had come from the Middle East, the presence of tartaric acid or tartrate would have definitively signaled a grape product such as wine, because in this region this acid or its salt is found only in grapes. In China, however, tartaric acid occurs in several other fruits—not only hawthorn but also Asiatic cornelian cherry (Cornus officialis, or shan chu yu) and longyan ( Euphoria longyan, long yan)—which thus might have been ingredients. Smaller amounts of tartaric acid can also be derived from other plant sources native to the region, such as the leaves of Pelargonium or other flowers in the geranium family. Mold saccharification, the process by which fungi break down rice starches into sugar prior to making Chinese rice wine or Japanese sake (see below), also produces about 0.1–2.0 milligrams of tartaric acid per liter. That, however, is too dilute a concentration to explain the consistently high tartaric acid levels in the ancient samples, and we also know that this method of beverage making probably developed very late in China, perhaps only in the Han dynasty (ca. 202 B.C.– A.D. 220). Only the presence of hawthorn fruit or grape came close to explaining our experimental results.

The molds break down the carbohydrates in rice and other grains into simple, fermentable sugars. Historically, a special moldand-yeast starter (qu) was first prepared by growing a thick mass of mold on various steamed cereals and pulses.

Fortunately for us, one particular compound settles out from the liquid during the processing and storing of barley beer. Calcium oxalate, known as beerstone by brewers, is the simplest of organic acid salts, combined with ionic calcium. It’s a very bitter, potentially poisonous compound, so it is a good thing to eliminate it from the brew. The pores in the pottery helped do this by removing the calcium oxalate from the brew at the same time that it helped to preserve the compound for our extraction and analysis thousands of years later.

Resinated wines were greatly appreciated in antiquity, as we have come to see in analyzing wines from all over the Middle East, extending from the Neolithic down to the Byzantine period. Although some wine drinkers today turn up their noses at a resinated wine, now made only in Greece as retsina, the technique is analogous to ageing in oak. The result can actually be quite appealing: the Gaia Estate’s Ritinitis has a mildly citrusy flavor, achieved by adding a very slight touch of Aleppo pine resin to a Greek grape variety. Even the Romans added resins such as pine, cedar, terebinth (known as the “queen of resins”), frankincense, and myrrh to all their wine except extremely fine vintages. According to Pliny the Elder, who devoted a good part of book 14 of his Natural History to resinated wines, myrrh-laced wine was considered the best and most expensive.

Our risks paid off when we found a hermaphroditic wild plant which was positioned between a wild male and female vine, exactly the situation that an early viticulturalist would have needed to observe and select for. What makes the domesticated Eurasian grapevine so desirable is that it is hermaphroditic: male stamens and female pistils are located together in the same flowers on the plant, whereas for the wild variety, male and female flowers occur on separate plants. The proximity of the sexual organs on the hermaphroditic plants ensures the production of much more fruit on a predictable basis. This self-fertilizing plant could then be selected for desirable traits, such as sweeter, juicier fruit or thinner skins, and cloned by propagation of branches, buds, or roots.

Neither Schmidt nor Mithen went on to speculate about whether the local wheats were used to make bread or beer, and no chemical analyses of vessels from the site have yet been carried out. Neither einkorn nor emmer is ideal for making beer, because they yield insufficient diastase enzymes, when the cereals are sprouted, to break down the starches into sugar. Barley accomplishes this objective more effectively: in modern brewing, a wheat beer is made by mixing in some barley malt to promote the saccharification of the wheat polysaccharides.

When desiccated, figs are the most sugar-rich fruit in nature. Fifty percent of their dry weight consists of simple sugars. In liquid form, figs contain about 15 percent sugar, less than grapes and bananas. Such a sweet fruit would be a natural candidate for a fermented beverage.

Ephedra’s main active alkaloid, ephedrine, a chemical analogue of noradrenalin, stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and induces a mild euphoria. In small amounts, it produces an amphetamine-like high; in larger amounts, it can induce hallucinations and even cardiac arrest. Modern recreational users of herbal ecstasy, made from ephedra, attest to its psychoactive potency. Marijuana contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is related to anandamide, an endogenous neurotransmitter; it is also euphoric and sometimes stimulates the imagination. The milky latex of poppyseed capsules, which is called opium when congealed, provides a highly concentrated amalgam of some forty powerful mind-altering alkaloids, including codeine, morphine, papaverine, and narcotine. The leaves, which can be smoked, have lesser amounts of these substances.

Other flowers and spices include the “string flower,” a member of the Piper genus and similarly peppery; magnolia flowers; the “popcorn flower,” with a rose scent; ceiba seeds; sapote seeds, with a bitter almond flavor; chilis of all kinds; allspice (Pimenta officianalis), which contributes pumpkin accents; and achiote or annatto (Bixa orellana), which colors the beverage an intense red.

Northwestern Mexico was also the epicenter of a hallucinogenic cult in which peyote (Lophophora williamsii) was consumed by decocting the exposed part of the cactus, the so-called mescal button, as a tea. The active alkaloid in peyote is mescaline, derived from phenylethylamine, one of the compounds also found in cacao.

Although we couldn’t get the cacao fruit, we tracked down a purveyor of dark chocolate (Askinosie Chocolate in Missouri) that could provide us with cacao nibs and powder from the premier area of Aztec chocolate production, Soconusco. Its bitterness would be offset by the honey and corn. The herb achiote would provide a special touch of intense red, recalling the Aztecs’ preoccupation with human sacrifice. Finally, some chills would add zest to the concoction, but rather than fiery-hot habañero, we settled on the milder ancho. We might also have tossed in peppery “ear flower” or a hallucinogenic mushroom if they had been available.

The peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) is one example: its sap and pinkish fruit pulp make a delicious, mildly alcoholic drink. Chonta and coyol palms, wild pineapple (Ananas bracteatus), the plumlike Gourliea decorticans, cacti (including Opuntia tuna and the saguaro), and Tizyphus mistol, which looks like a luscious grape, were among a host of other possibilities. The drinks could be mixed with more powerful herbs, such as ground tobacco or coca leaves; the seeds of angel’s trumpet (Brugmansia spp.); a decoction of San Pedro cactus or seed pods of the yopo or cebil tree (Anadenanthera spp.), rich in indoxyl compounds; or a tea made from ayahuasca (literally “vine of the soul”; Banisteriopsis spp.), which produces visual hallucinations and today is the focus of a rapidly expanding shamanistic New Age religion.

Sweet potatoes and manioc were chewed to make beer. In the Yucatán and the Chiapas highlands, a mead was fermented from the native honey. The Lacandón Maya of Chiapas prepared theirs in quantity in hollowed-out logs shaped like canoes, to which the bark of one particular tree, the balché (Lonchocarpus longistylus), was added. A Spanish informant described it as “milk white, sour to the smell, and at first very disagreeable to the taste.” Of course, an alcoholic beverage could also be spiked with a hallucinogenic drug derived from the seeds of morning glory (Ipomoea and Turbina spp.) or the psilocybin mushroom.

Sweet and luscious Ziziphus fruit is recorded not only at early Neolithic Nabta Playa but also at contemporaneous sites on the upper Nile in Sudan and at late Neolithic Naqada, close to Hierakonpolis along the middle Nile. Hackberry (Celtis spp.), which we have already surmised might have been used to make a fermented beverage at Neolithic Çatal Höyük in Turkey, is attested at the same Sudanese sites and at fourth-millennium B.C. Kadero, north of Khartoum; it shows up in Mauritania, in the western Sahel, between 1500 and 500 B.C. Dried fruits of the fig, soapberry tree, and other plants were recovered from caves in the remote Tadrart Acacus mountains of the Libyan Sahara. Moreover, many of these fermentable fruits were associated with traditional medicinal additives to wine and beer—for example, caper, Rumex, and borage—or could themselves have been used as principal ingredients. The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), a later source of fruit for making a potent wine, is also in evidence in the Tadrart Acacus around 6000 B.C. and is the basis for beer drinks in modern Darfur.
